                In the years since, HTML as a language grew to develop several new key features, such as the ability to display images, video, and other media. This would lead to the development of more complex websites that could be used for a variety of purposes, from personal blogs to e-commerce sites. 8 bit colour was also fairly common, as monitors could finally display more than just black and white. Despite this, the designs of websites were still fairly simple due to the speed of the internet, and the limitations of the technology. 
                <p></p>
                Various decorative elements were finally introduced, giving 'web masters' the option to use more styling than just the bare minimum in 1.0. Borders, audio players, sign up pages and simple animations became available with the inclusion of several new tags and better integration of css/javascript in 1996. SVG's such as the lines that you see on this site would also be introduced slightly later in 1999.

                This era of the internet would later be named web 1.0, where most websites were only connected by hyperlinks, and who's users were majority researchers, large companies, and some hobbyists. Despite this, the role of the 'web designer' was born in the form of the 'web master'. Of course, later this role split into several different ones as designs became more complicated.
